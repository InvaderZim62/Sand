# Sand Art

I tried to re-create those sand art pictures, where you flip the frame, and the sand falls to
the bottom looking like a mountain range.  I used SceneKit to create three sand particle types
with different radii, mass, friction, and damping.  I also added air bubles to create a wall,
where the sand breaks through in discrete places.  It didn't work as well as I hoped.  Maybe
you can do better.

The animation starts after I flipped my iPhone over.
